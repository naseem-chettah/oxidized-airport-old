  <p>So I think I’ve talked before about this school project but in case I didn’t it was supposed to be creating a simple data base setup for a hypothetical airport (I have no damn idea if that how you spell that word but yeah it sounds about right to me!). But you know me, I love to over-complicate shit. So now I’m basically working on an across platform front-end for this DB, which btw I’ll be using the SurrealDB DBMS for.</p>
